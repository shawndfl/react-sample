# React Sample

This sample use React and node to produce a 3D simulate. The 3D rendering use [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) which uses WebGl. I created the models my self using blender and importing them into the scene using [gltf](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/). The web development was done using React and Typescript. React Hooks were uses along with [mui](https://mui.com/).
